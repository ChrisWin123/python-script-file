# python-script-file
A simple Python program where you try to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100.
It has a repetition code structure as of now. I will improve my lines of code in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How It Works:-
The system randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
You choose a difficulty level:

    Easy → 10 attempts
    Medium → 5 attempts
    Hard → 3 attempts

After each guess, the program gives hints if the guess is too high or too low.
A timer tracks how long it takes to guess the number.
At the end, you can choose to play again.

Features:-

✔Difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
✔Number hints (Too high / Too low)
✔Timer to track time taken
✔Error handling for invalid inputs
✔ Play again option
